# catalog_creation

a set of programs and notebooks used for processing GOGREEN cluster images for catalog creation 

Getting started:
First, install source extractor (2.19.5 or newer) into the source_extractor folder

Next, install sewpy

Next, place your relevant HST or other images into the HSTdata area. I'd recommend a separate directory for each cluster since you'll be making a lot of additional files associated with each cluster.

Then you can proceed with reading the manual (pdf) and following its directions.
